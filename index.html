                        election. Mitchell is the assistant editor for Antares science-fiction/fantasy magazine, a
                        member of Stuyvesant’s Volleyball Team, and a member of the Step Crew. As an idealist, he leads
                        discussions and listens to the potential story ideas others may have for the magazine. His
                        creative and imaginative nature drives him in his pursuits to reform America for the better.
                        Mitchell’s teamwork and ability to work well with others are evident in his commitment to both
                        his sports and step team and translates to his skill in uniting everyone by facilitating and
                        combining the different suggestions. As a Big Sib, Mitchell serves as an individual that
                        underclassmen can turn to when they need guidance. Working with children and helping TA staff
                        at CAPA Summer Camp, he has formed a personal connection to his community as a counselor and he
                        wishes to reach all Americans on a national scale. Mitchell is excited to embark on this
                        election process with Qianyu to implement policies that will help Americans and progress
                        America.

                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Born in China and raised in New York, Qianyu Wu is the child of immigrant
                        parents and a lower middle class family. Her upbringing has greatly influenced her interest in
                        politics and zeal to assist those of a similar background. Qianyu Wu is the treasurer for
                        Science Olympiad and a member of Speech and Debate Team at Stuyvesant. As the treasurer for
                        Science Olympiad, she has had the responsibility of budget planning and regulating the
                        financial expenses for the club. The Speech and Debate Team has allowed Qianyu to be personally
                        connected to the controversial issues she speaks out against and become an advocate for the
                        rights of people with different backgrounds. Through her internship at the Queens Supreme
                        Court, Qianyu had firsthand experience of observing unfair court trials, the lack of assistance
                        and care for the elderly and disabled, and forceful removal of illegal immigrants from the
                        court. The exposure to these problems has only deepened her passion and commitment to improving
                        the country by establishing equal opportunity. Dedicated to providing a brighter future for
                        Americans, Qianyu hopes to ensure a government that is not only impartial and proactive but
                        also one that takes care of its people.

                        Asian Americans, African Americans, Latin Americans, white Americans. What's the difference?
                        Despite all these races or tags, we are all Americans. We are the people of this nation. Every
                        voice matters. With the recent Midterm election, we see the rise of minorities. We are looking
                        at the rise diversity of our country. We need new faces in Congress, new voices in politics,
                        and new ideas in the air that reflect this diversity. We need a president who truly listens to
                        the voices of every single American. It’s not about my voice or my ideas &horbar; it’s about
                        you. As your presidential candidate, I desire your voice. My staff and I have worked hard to
                        form a platform that is about what your desires, and not just mine. Because we listen, our
                        policies are formulated around the issues you care about.

                                        Students often complain that they take classes that aren't relevant and learn
                                        things that they'll never use again. We want to improve the quality of schools
                                        by improvising more relevant courses, with the option to take more advanced
                                        classes.
                                        Education from K-11th grade essentially lead up to the college process, and we
                                        understand that it is a stressful one. That's why we aim to waive college
                                        application fees, and have schools provide more resources that will aid
                                        students in the process.
                                        Furthermore, U.S. schools will provide improved mental health care and guidance
                                        services for all students to help relieve stress and ultimately reduce suicide
                                        rates.

                                        We want to create a federal program that would allow for more internship

                                        exercise social networking skills that many students lack. President FDR’s New

                                        can do the same, but better. Following the precedent President FDR laid, we can
                                        revise and create a new plan to create jobs for those who are unemployed and in
                                        school. Furthermore we will enforce minimum wage. A majority of those workers

                                        In recent years, so many school and public shootings have been brought to
                                        national attention.
                                        This should not be the case. We will strengthen background checks and mental
                                        health screenings
                                        for any looking to purchase or own a gun. The right to bear arms is a
                                        constitutional right, but
                                        we cannot and should not allow those who have poor mental health or a history
                                        of violence to bear such arms.

                        The United States will try to coexist with China as global superpowers to prevent further
                        tensions with China and avoid the Thucydides's Trap. However, China needs a more open economic
                        policy. The Chinese government needs to minimize subsidizing their state-owned companies to
                        give equal opportunities for every company across the world to gain contracts.
                        Business espionage and violation of U.S. sanctions must be stopped.
                        In order to maintain friendly relations with both China and Taiwan, we aim to try policies
                        similar to the Ping-Pong Diplomacy during the Nixon administration. We will try to slowly
                        persuade China to allow Taiwanese people to choose whether or not they want to be a part of
                        China.
